Three more interviews from RustFest 2019: [Jake Shadle](https://twitter.com/Ca1ne){:target="_blank"} on using Rust for high-performance game engines at [Embark](https://www.embark-studios.com/){:target="_blank"}, applying lessons learned from working on EA DICE's Frostbite engine; [Yoshua Wuyts](https://twitter.com/yoshuawuyts){:target="_blank"} on `async-std` and Rust's async ecosystem; and [Stjepan Glavina](https://twitter.com/stjepang){:target="_blank"} on `crossbeam`, Rust's foundational library for powerful concurrency primitives.

#### [@15:09] Part 2: `async-std` w/ Yoshua Wuyts

- [@15:48] - How much of the Rust standard library is `async-std` intended to emulate?
- [@17:12] - Is there anything from `async-std` that ought to be upstreamed into the standard library?
