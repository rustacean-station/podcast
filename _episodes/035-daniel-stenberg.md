First time guest host, Allen Wyma talks with Daniel, the original author of cURL, about using Rust in cURL.

- [cURL](https://curl.se/){:target="_blank"} is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.
- cURL, and its data transfer core, libcurl are both written in C, which is known to be not memory safe. 
- While it is almost impossibe to rewrite it into another language, offering a third-party library written in Rust could take a further step forward.
