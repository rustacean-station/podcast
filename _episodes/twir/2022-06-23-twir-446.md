- [@00:08:38] - [Quote of the
  week](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31616966)
  > I wrote a bespoke time-series database in Rust a few years ago, and it has
  > had exactly one issue since I stood it up in production, and that was due to
  > pessimistic filesystem access patterns, rather than the language. This thing
  > is handling hundreds of thousands of inserts per second, and it's even
  > threaded.
  >
  > Given that I've been programming professionally for over a decade in Python,
  > Perl, Ruby, C, C++, Javascript, Java, and Rust, I'll pick Rust absolutely
  > any time that I want something running that I won't get called at 3 AM to
  > fix. It probably took me 5 times as long to write it as if I did it in Go or
  > Python, but I guarantee it's saved me 10 times as much time I would have
  > otherwise spent triaging, debugging, and running disaster recovery.
