#### [@00:00] Welcome

- [@00:10] - Introduction
- [@00:50] - Agenda
- [@01:23] - [Quote of the week](https://lobste.rs/s/wiavtb/rust_critical_retrospective#c_jkfhpb)
  > This is the difference in approaches of the two languages. In C++ if the
  > code is vulnerable, the blame is on the programmer. In Rust if the code is
  > vulnerable, Rust considers it a failure of the language, and takes
  > responsibility to stop even “bad” programmers from writing vulnerable code.
  > I can’t stress enough how awesome it is that I can be a careless fool, and
  > still write perfectly robust highly multi-threaded code that never crashes.
  - [@03:09] Allen: Rust is both good and bad at marketing

#### [@08:07] Highlights

- [@08:27] - [Developer survey: JavaScript and Python reign, but Rust is rising](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3661248/developer-survey-javascript-and-python-reign-but-rust-is-rising.html)
  - [@09:09] - Sean: "Rust adoption has nearly quadrupled in the last two years, going from
   600k developers in Q1 2022 to 2.2m in Q1 2022."
- [@13:00] - [Redust](https://github.com/appellation/redust) by [Will Nelson](https://wnelson.dev/)
  - [@13:50] Allen: I think the comments are actually more interesting. They
    are starting to point to something really&mdash;I don't know whether it's
    good or bad for the community&mdash;where, you know, people start rolling
    their own crates instead of, say, doing stuff upstream. It kind of goes back
    to what [Tim was complaining about before](https://rustacean-station.org/episode/069-twir-441/) [Easy Mode for
    Rust, discussed on This Week in Rust - Issue 441]&mdash;well, lightly
    pointing out to people out there&mdash;that okay, now which crate should I
    use?
  - [@16:20] Tim: Open source is really complicated. You need to talk to
    people. That's &#8230; challenging. [Laughs]
  - [@16:40] [Josh Triplett on Building with
    Rust](https://anchor.fm/building-with-rust/episodes/Josh-Triplett-on-Building-the-Build-System-of-his-Dreams-e1dt81c),
   discussing the orphan rule
  - [@16:50] Sean: Rust is not very good at sharing between crates.

  Retrospective](https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=6375) by [bunnie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Huang_(hacker))

      runs the [Xous microkernel operating  system](https://betrusted.io/xous-book/)
  - [@21:07] - Tim: Security-critical applications have issues when they ... rely on Rust.
      There's one quote I want to pull out of the post, which is: "I’m not sure
      if there is even a good solution to this problem, but, if you are
      super-paranoid and your goal is to be able to build trustable firmware, be
      wary of Rust’s expansive software supply chain attack surface!"
  - [@26:09] - Sean: bunnie I think that you are absolutely, totally, qualified.
  - [@30:17] - Allen: I did see a macro that he put in there. ... I forget
    extact. It was very crazy and I was like, "Come on, no one's every going to
    write something crazy like this" and then I took a look at the RFC that
    Sean's gonna do and in the comments there was a crazy one like that and I
    was like, "oh wow, this guy's point's valid".
  - [@30:49] - [Hyrum's Law](https://www.hyrumslaw.com/), named after [Hyrum
    Wright](https://twitter.com/hyrumwright).

    > promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be
    > depended on by somebody.

  - [@54:40] Tim: I want to bring out a comment that was made to me in private,
    because I've been toying with the idea of becoming a `rustc` contributor,
    particularly on the standard library side, and [Ashley
    Mannix](https://twitter.com/kodraus) sent me a really lovely note, which
    was: "Rust is also chronically friendly so nobody gets chewed out for making mistakes. They happen. They get caught. They get patched. You learn something new. It's ok.".
