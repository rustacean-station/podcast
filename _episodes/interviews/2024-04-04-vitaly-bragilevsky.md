[Vitaly Bragilevsky](https://bravit.pro/), Developer Advocate at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) and author of 
[Haskell in depth](https://www.manning.com/books/haskell-in-depth), sits down with Luca Palmieri.

Vitaly explains what led JetBrains to launch a Rust-specific product, [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/).
He covers, in particular, why it is a good time to invest further in Rust, touching as well on the state of the Rust ecosystem. 
Luca and Vitaly also touch on the status quo of Rust developer tooling, including debuggers, profilers (or the lack thereof!),
and framework-specific extensions.
