[Rob Ede](https://github.com/sponsors/robjtede), lead maintainer of [Actix Web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web), explains to Marco Otto-Witte how (and why) [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) chose to migrate their microservices to Rust.   

They also discuss Rust's web development ecosystem at large, with a particular focus on [Actix Web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web): Rob shares his view on how improvements in the language and framework space will eventually lead to a future where web development in Rust can be as approachable as web development in Javascript.
