Allen Wyma talks with [Andrew Lamb](http://andrew.nerdnetworks.org/) about [InfluxDB's rewrite](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/flight-datafusion-arrow-parquet-fdap-architecture-influxdb/). InfluxDB is an open-source time series database.

As a Staff Engineer at InfluxData, he works on InfluxDB 3.0, a new time series database written in Rust, focusing on query processing and the Apache Arrow DataFusion and Apache Arrow ecosystems. In that capacity, he is a member and past chair of the Apache Arrow PMC and actively contributes to Apache Arrow DataFusion and the Apache Rust implementation query engine.

Andrew was a professional C/C++ programmer for 10 years before switching to Rust. His experience ranges from startups to large multinational corporations and distributed open source projects, and has paid leadership dues as an architect and manager/VP. He holds an SB and MEng from MIT in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
